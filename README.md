# How to Become a More Effective Learner

Learning How to Learn, is a [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course taught by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, Offered By McMaster University and University of California San Diego. I like the course, as a firm believer in lifelong learning, I'd like to keep improving my learning skills, therefore made this GitHub project, so maybe this can inspire others.

## Focused mode and diffuse mode

🐙

The two types of networks that the brain switches between.

### Focused mode

🐡

- Highly attentive states.
- Our neural pathways link brain areas, such related to what we are thinking.
- Relates to an intense concentration on a specific problem or concept.

#### Use focused mode to learn concepts, basic, fundamental knowledge.

🐳

### Diffuse mode

🐠

is a more relaxed, resting state.

- Where our neural pathways randomly link brain areas.
- Often involves a big-picture.
- After hard focused work, relax, and do things that allow diffuse mode to take over.

#### Diffuse mode often helps us generate new ideas, being creative, understand things at the concept level.

🐣

#### Benefit from both focused and diffuse modes,

to learn more effectively and being creative.

## Working and Long-term memory

🧠

### Working memory

Immediately and consciously processing in our mind.

🐟

- It is believed that working memory holds only about 4 chunks of information.
- Like a computer Random Access Memory, relatively small in capacity and stores information temporarily.

### Long-term memory

🦑

- is like storage or a computer hard disk, relatively bigger capacity, can store information longer time.
- important for learning, because we need to store fundamental knowledge to learn more advanced.
- Move information from working memory to long-term memory takes time.

#### Spaced repetition

💫

**spacing repetition out over some days** is a good way to move working memory to long-term memory.

Long-term memory needs to be revisited occasionally to keep the memories accessible.

### Create visual metaphors, analogies, and stories

🧜

- To help remember and understand concepts.
- To see something in our mind's eye.

#### Helpful not only in art, and literature, but also allow the scientific, and engineering world to make progress.

🐾

Help to avoid being blocked by thinking about problems in the wrong ways.

## Sleep

💤

Studies have shown that sleep is a vital part of memory and learning.

### During sleep, our brain:

🌀

- Erase trivial memories.
- Strengthen areas of importance.
- Rehearses some tougher parts we trying to learn.
- Going over and over neural patterns to deepen and strengthen them.

#### Strength our ability to:

🕵

- Figure out difficult problems.
- Find meaning and understanding of what we are learning.

### Learning, try to understand or solve problems right before a nap or sleep

👼

- Increase the chance of dreaming about it.
- Enhance our ability to understand it.

#### Make a next day plan before sleep

🧚

so our subconscious, *diffuse* thinking processes can have a chance to help assist us in actually accomplishing the tasks the next day.

#### Too little sleep

🤕

over a too long time is associated with headaches, depression, heart disease, diabetes, and dying earlier.

## Chunk

🎟

Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning

#### When we chunk an idea or concept,

we do not need to remember all underlying details.

🚴

It's like riding a bike, we only need the main idea of biking, all the underlying complex biking activities take place with that simple chunk of thought.

#### One of the first steps toward gaining expertise in math and science is to create conceptual chunks.

🔬

#### When we grasp one chunk 

✨

- it can be related in surprising ways to other similar chunks,
- not only in the field we are learning but also in very different fields.

#### When we have a good library of chunks

💢

our diffuse mode can connect chunks in new ways to solve new problems.

### Chunking (how to form chunks)

🧙‍♂️

#### Focus on the information we want to chunk

🎯

- focused mode reaches through the slots of working memory to make connections in various parts of the brain,
- to tie together ideas,
- often helps us to create chunks.

#### My brain doesn't seem to work

🤯

- When we are angry, stressed, or afraid, 
- our brain begins to lose the ability to make connections in various parts.

#### Understanding

🗿

- Understand the basic idea we trying to chunk.
- Understanding helps hold the underlying memory traces together.
- A chunk without understanding is a useless chunk, that won't fit in with other material we are learning.

#### Draw idea or concept

🗃

- "Chunking" involves compressing information,
- so it is easier to draw a "chunked" idea or concept into mind.

#### Gain context, seeing how and when to use the chunk

🧐

- Going beyond the initial problem, seeing more broadly.
- Repeat and practice with both related and unrelated problems.
- Knowing when to use and when not use the chunk.
- Fit the chunk into the bigger picture.

#### Like a tool we use

🔧

if we understand it, know how to and when to use (not use), have a big picture of the tool, we can benefit most from it.

## Illusions of competence

🎈

#### When we repeatedly read notes or textbook

📑

- When we draw lines under important sentences or mark them with colors.
- But with relatively few engage in self-testing or retrieval practice.

#### When we have the book (or Google) open right in front of us

📖

- It provides the illusion that the material is also in our brain, **but it's not.**

#### Avoid illusions of competence

🚑

- **Test** ourselves on what we are learning, make sure we are not fooling ourselves.
- **Recall** allowing us to see whether or not we really grasp the idea.

## The importance of recall

💭

### Using recall, 

mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make study time more focused and effective.

🔭

By recall and practicing material, we can learn more and deeper than any other study approach.

#### Recall while outside our usual study place

🏖

Recalling material when outside usual place of study help us strengthen our grasp of material by viewing it from a different perspective.

#### Do not wait too long,

⌛

to practice recall, we do not want to start from scratch again.

## Testing

🌈

Testing is a powerful learning experience.

- Take a test is more effective than study without it.

### Mini tests

📚

Research has shown that testing during studies is one of the best ways to understand and retain information.

- The test process becomes routine and a natural extension of the learning process.

### Start hard, jump to easy

🧚‍♂️

When we start solving problems, start first with the hardest one, when we get stuck, jump to another problem immediately.

- When we switch our attention away, it allows the diffuse mode to begin its work, then come back with a *big picture* perspective.

## Continuous Development

🏗

The great wall of China was not built in one day.

#### In software development,

⚙

rather than improving in one large batch, updates are often made continuously, piece by piece.

#### Persistent

🐝

Divide our learning or goal into small doses, and do a little every day.

- Give focused and diffuse modes the time to understand what we are learning.
- As we repeat we active our long-term memory.

#### Learning is like gaining muscles

💪

It wouldn't happen overnight, we train, eat, sleep, and our muscles grow bigger over time.

#### Fit our level

🏋️

Same as a workout, lift too heavy may physically hurt us, right technique, lift a weight that we can handle.

#### It's important to have positive feedback to gain motivation to continue.

🌟

#### Deliberate practice

⛷

on the toughest aspects of the material, continuously.

- Can help lift average brains into the realm of those with natural gifts.
- Similar to lift heavier weights, which leads our muscles to grow bigger and quicker.
- We can also practice certain mental patterns that deepen and enlarge our minds.

#### By deliberate practice, we can also gain better results.

🍇

## Interleaving

☯️

Practice a mixture of different kinds of problems using different strategies, versus overlearning.

#### Interleaving our studies

🚀

- by skipping around through problems in different chapters and materials,
- seems to make learning more difficult.
- but it helps us learn more deeply.

### Overlearning

🔨

Once we got the basic idea down during a session, continuing at it doesn't strengthen the long-term memory connections we want.

Worsely, focusing on one technique is like learning carpentry by only practicing the hammer. After a while, we may think that anything can be fixed by just bashing it.

## Physical exercise

🤸‍♂️

- We once fault thought that neurons in our brain wouldn't grow as adults.
- But we now know that in a few places, new neurons are born every day.
- One of these places is very important for learning.
- Exercise assists our brain to grow new neurons.

#### New neurons help us learn new things

🍂

*but they will die if we do not use them.*

- New experiences will rescue them.
- Learn new subject areas.
- Traval exotic foreign country, experience differents.

#### Exercises

also, **help the nervous to survive.**

🌱

- Exercise is by far better than any drugs on the markets.
- Exercise benefits all of our other organisms.
- It's a good way of interleaving our learning or problem-solving.
- Give our brain time to practice diffuse thinking.
