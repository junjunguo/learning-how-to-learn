# How to Become a More Effective Learner

## Focused mode and diffuse mode

🐙

The two types of networks that the brain switches wetween.

### Focused mode

🐡

- Highly attentive states.
- Our neural pathways link brain areas, related to what we thinking.
- Relates to intense concentration on specific problem or concept.

#### Use focused mode to learn concepts, basic, foundmental knowledge.

🐳

### Diffuse mode

🐠

- Is a more relaxed, resting state.
- Where our neural pathways randomly link brain areas.
- Often involves a big-picture.
- After hard focused work, relax, and do things that allow diffuse mode to take over.

#### Diffuse mode often help us generate new ideas, being creative, understand things at concept level.

🐣

#### Benefit from both focused and diffuse modes,

to learn more effectively, and being creative.

## Working and Long term memory

🧠

### Working memory
    
Immediately and consciously processing in our mind.

- It is believed that working memory holds only about 4 chunks of information.
- Like a computer Random Access Memory, relatively small in capacity and store information temporarily.

### Long term memory

- Like a storage or a computer harddisk, relatively bigger capacity, can store information longer time.
- Important for learning, because we need to store fundamental knowledge to learn more advanced.
- Move information from working memory to long term memory takes time.

#### Spaced repetition 

💫

*spacing repetition out over a number of days* is a good way to move working memory to long term memory.

Long term memory needs to be revisited occasionally to keep the memories accessible.

### Create visual metaphors, analogies, and stories

☯️

- To help remember and understand concepts.
- To see something in our mind's eye.

#### Helpful not only in art and literature, but also allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress.

Also help to avoid being blocked by thinking about problems in wrong ways.

## Sleep

💤

Studies have shown that sleep is a vital part of memory and learning.

### During sleep, our brain: 

🌀

- Erase trivial memories. 
- Strengthen areas of importantce.
- Rehearses some tougher parts we trying to learn.
- Going over and over neural patterns to deppen and strengthen them.

#### Strength our ability to: 

✨

- Figure out difficult problems.
- Find meaning and understanding in what we are learning.

### Learing, try to understand or solve problems right before a nap or sleep

- Increase the chance of dreaming about it.
- Enhace our ability to understand it.

#### Make a next day plan before sleep

## Chunk

🎫

#### Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning

🎟

#### When we chunk an idea or concept, 

we do not need to remember all underlying details.

🚴

It's like riding a bike, we only need the main idea biking, all the underlying complex biking activites take place with that simple chunk of thought.

#### One of the first steps toward gaining expertise in math and science is to create conceptual chunks.

### Chunking (how to form chunks)

🥗

#### Focus our attention on the information we want to chunk.

🎯

#### Understand the basic idea we trying to chunk

- Understanding helps hold the underlying memory traces together.
- A chunk without understand, is a useless chunk that won't fit in with other material we are learning.

#### Gain context, seeing how and when to use the chunk

- Going beyond the initial problem, seeing more broadly.
- Repeat and practice with both related and unrelated problems.
- Knowing when to use and when not use the chunk.
- Fit the chunk into the bigger picture.

#### Like a tool we use, 

🔧

if we understand it, know how and when to use (not use), have big picture of the tool, we can benefit most of that it.

## Avoid illusions of competence

🎈

#### When we repeatedly read notes or textbook 

📑

- When we draw lines under important centences, or mark them with colors.
- But with relatively few engage in self-testing or retrieval practice.

#### When we have the book (or Google) open right in front of us

📖

- It provides the illusion that the material is also in our brain, **but it's not.**

## The importance of recall

💭

#### Using recall, mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make study time more focused and effective.

🔭

by recall and practice material, we can learn more and deeper than any other study approach.

#### Do not wait too long to practice recall, we do not want to start from scratch every time.

## Consistent

🐜

The great wall of China was not build in one day.

#### Divide

🐝

learning or goal to small doses, and do a little every day

- Give focused and diffuse modes the time to understand what we are learning.
- As we repeat we active our long term memory.

#### Learning is like gaining muscles

💪

It wouldn't happen overnight, we train, eat, sleep, and muscles grow bigger over time.

#### Fit our level

🏋️

Same as workout, lift too heavy may physically hurt us, right technique, lift weight that we can handle.

#### It's important to have positive feedback to gain motivation to continue.

🌟

#### Deliberate practice 

on the toughest aspects of the material. 

- Can help lift average brains into the realm of those with natural gifts.
- Similar to lift heavier weights, which lead our muscles to grow bigger and quicker.
- We can also practice certain mental patterns that deepen and enlarge in our mind.

####  By deliberate practice we can also gain better results.

🍇

##  Physical exercise

🤸‍♂️

- We once fault thought that all of the neurons in the brain won't grow as adults.
- But we now know that in a few places, new neurons are born every day.
- One of these places is very important for learning new things.

#### New neurons help us learn new things

*but they will die if we do not use them.* 

- New experiences will rescue them.

#### Physical exercises 

also **help the nervous to survive.**

🌱

- Exercise is by far better than any drugs on the markets.
- Exercise benefits all of our other organisms.
- It's a good way of interleaving our learning or problem solving.
- Give our brain time to practice diffuse thinking.
